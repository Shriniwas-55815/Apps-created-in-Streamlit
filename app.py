### Salary Prediction App

The **Salary Prediction App** is an interactive web application designed to estimate a person's monthly or annual salary based on their years of work experience.  
This application uses a pre-trained **Simple Linear Regression model** to make predictions, ensuring accuracy and reliability. """)
